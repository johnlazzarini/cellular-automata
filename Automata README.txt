This project was done as part of a course on software engineering -- the brief "main"
method was provided to me by an instructor, but the core mechanics and algorithms are of my own
design and development.  Since the functionality of this program is non trivial, I have
provided more documentation than I normally would to explain various
method features and purposes.
